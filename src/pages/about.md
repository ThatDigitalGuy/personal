# About Me

![Rhys on a rock.](https://ik.imagekit.io/uncencform/static/447436275_471083248834717_9198133434154739030_n_yQPq1dOMb.jpg?updatedAt=1730122355272)

Yes, before you ask, I may have just took my Instagram profile picture... I have no idea where the original is. Anyway, as you can tell by the blog, I don't want anything fancy with design. I like to keep it simple, so my mind keeps it simple as well. 

## A little about me.

I am a current apprentice living and working in the UK. I aspire to be a network engineer or administrator, since I find networking and security really... and I mean really cool. My current hobbies is watching TV or Movies and I do love messing around in new software that may help in my career.
